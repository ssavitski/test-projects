adapt-xapi
===============

An extension to track learner activity via xAPI. Please note, this is a pre-alpha release and is not ready for production use.

# Requirements

* A Learning Record Store (LRS) - [LearningLocker](https://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker/) is recommended.

# How to Install

This plugin is not yet officially supported by the Adapt project, and requires a couple of manual steps in order to use it effectively.

1. From GitHub, click Download ZIP. This will download a file called adapt-xapi-master.zip file.
2. From within your AdaptBuilder web interface, click the top-left drop-down menu and select 'Plugin Management'.
3. Click 'Upload Plugin'.
4. Choose the adapt-xapi-master.zip file downloaded earlier.
5. Click 'Upload'.


# How to Use

1. Create a new course and click "Manage Extensions" and enable the xAPI extension
2. The activityID for the module is currently hardcoded in the included tincan.xml.
    * The current activityID is https://bitbucket.org/dennis-learningpool/adapt-xapi.
    * You need to add this activity after enabling the extension on your authoring tool course by editing the xAPI section under Project Settings.
    * If you choose a different activityID than the one above, be sure to hand edit the published zip and set the activityid attribute in the tincan.xml file bundled in the root of the published course.
3. Unzip your published course to a location on the web.
4. Browse to the published course.
5. View LRS for xAPI statements.
